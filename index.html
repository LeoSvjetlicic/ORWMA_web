          <p id="light-shade-part">
            Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water
            over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis. After plain water,
            tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many
            different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and
            astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that
            include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating
            effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content.

        <p id="light-shade-part">
          People in ancient East Asia ate tea for centuries, perhaps even
          millennia, before ever consuming it as a beverage. They would nibble
          on the leaves raw, add them to soups or greens, or ferment them and
          chew it like how betel is chewed. An early credible record of tea
          drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by
          Chinese physician Hua Tuo. It was popularised as a recreational drink
          during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking subsequently spread
          to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants
          introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. During the 17th
          century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who
          started to plant tea on a large scale in British India.
