      <p>
        Pu'er or pu-erh[1] is a variety of fermented tea traditionally produced
        in Yunnan Province, China. In the context of traditional Chinese tea
        production terminology, fermentation refers to microbial fermentation
        (called 'wet piling'), and is typically applied after the tea leaves
        have been sufficiently dried and rolled.[2] As the tea undergoes
        controlled microbial fermentation, it also continues to oxidize, which
        is also controlled, until the desired flavors are reached. This process
        produces tea known as 黑茶 hēichá (lit. 'black tea') (which is different
        from the English-language black tea that is called 红茶 hóngchá (lit.
        'red tea') in Chinese). Pu'er falls under a larger category of fermented
        teas commonly translated as dark teas.

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Made from fermented and aged leaves. Considered a black tea, its leaves
        are pressed into cakes. One animal study showed that animals given
        pu-erh had less weight gain and reduced LDL cholesterol.

      <h4>Raw pu'er</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Over time, raw pu'er acquires an earthy flavor due to slow oxidation and
        other, possibly microbial processes. However, this oxidation is not
        analogous to the oxidation that results in green, oolong, or black tea,
        because the process is not catalyzed by the plant's own enzymes but
        rather by fungal, bacterial, or autooxidation influences. Pu'er flavors
        can change dramatically over the course of the aging process, resulting
        in a brew tasting strongly earthy but clean and smooth, reminiscent of
        the smell of rich garden soil or an autumn leaf pile, sometimes with
        roasted or sweet undertones. Because of its ability to age without
        losing "quality", well aged good pu'er gains value over time in the same
        way that aged roasted oolong does.

      <h4>Ripe pu'er</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Since the ripening process was developed to imitate aged raw pu'er, many
        arguments surround the idea of whether aging ripened pu'er is desirable.
        Mostly, the issue rests on whether aging ripened pu'er will, for better
        or worse, alter the flavor of the tea. It is often recommended to age
        ripened pu'er to air out the unpleasant musty flavors and odors formed
        due to maocha fermentation. However, some collectors argue that keeping
        ripened pu'er longer than 10 to 15 years makes little sense, stating
        that the tea will not develop further and possibly lose its desirable
        flavors. Others note that their experience has taught them that ripened
        pu'er indeed does take on nuances through aging,[37] and point to
        side-by-side taste comparisons of ripened pu'er of different ages. Aging
        the tea increases its value, but may be unprofitable.
