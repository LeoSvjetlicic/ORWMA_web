          Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves
          and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation
          process which is used to make oolong teas and black teas. Green tea
          originated in China, and since then its production and manufacture has
          spread to other countries in East Asia.

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p id="light-shade-part">
          Made with steamed tea leaves, it has a high concentration of EGCG and
          has been widely studied. Green tea’s antioxidants may interfere with
          the growth of bladder, breast, lung, stomach, pancreatic, and
          colorectal cancers; prevent clogging of the arteries, burn fat,
          counteract oxidative stress on the brain, reduce risk of neurological
          disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, reduce risk of
          stroke, and improve cholesterol levels.

        <h4>Japanese Sencha Green Tea</h4>
        <p>
          Sencha is the most popular green tea in Japan, accounting for about
          80% of Japanese green tea production. In English, the literal
          translation is “tea that’s infused in water.” <br />To make sencha
          from loose leaves, try steeping it at 170-175 degrees Fahrenheit
          (76.5-79.5 degrees Celsius) for one minute. For a mellower flavor,
          brew it at 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73-74 degrees Celsius) for one and
          a half minutes.

        <h4>Matcha Green Tea</h4>
        <p>
          Matcha is a strong, full-bodied green tea made from specially
          prepared, finely powdered tea leaves. Most leaves used for making
          matcha powder are shade-grown, and the powder is labor-intensive to
          make, so matcha often commands a premium price. <br />To prepare
          matcha, add a teaspoon of the powder to three to five ounces of 175
          degrees Fahrenheit (79.5 degree Celsius) water in a wide-brimmed bowl
          and whisk it until it’s well-blended with a foamy upper layer.

        <h4>Jasmine Green Tea</h4>
        <p>
          As one of the most famous scented green teas, jasmine green tea first
          became popular in 17th-century China during the Qing Dynasty. Jasmine
          green tea is a true tea, but unlike sencha and matcha, it’s a type of
          flavored green tea. Green tea leaves are infused with the scent of
          jasmine flowers during oxidation.<br />Steep jasmine tea for two to
          four minutes at 175 degrees Fahrenheit (79.5 degrees Celsius). Longer
          steeping times will yield more jasmine scent and taste.

        <h4>Longjing (Dragon Well) Green Tea</h4>
        <p>
          Longjing or Dragon Well tea is the most famous, highest-quality
          hand-produced green tea from China. It originates from Longjing
          Village in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province.<br />
          This tea has a mellow, sweet, nutty flavor that contrasts pleasantly
          with its vegetal undertones and full body. You may notice hints of
          chestnut and sweet pea as you sip Longjing.<br />Steep this special
          tea in water that’s 167-176 degrees Fahrenheit (75-80 degrees Celsius)
          for one to three minutes.
