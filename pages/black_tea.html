    <h2>Black tea</h2>

        <p id="light-shade-part">
          Black tea, also translated to red tea in various East Asian languages,
          is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and
          green teas. Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than other
          teas. All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree)
          Camellia sinensis, though Camellia taliensis is also used rarely.
          <br />
          Two principal varieties of the species are used â€“ the small-leaved
          Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis var. sinensis), used for most other
          types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant (C. sinensis var.
          assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although
          in recent years some green and white teas have been produced.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p id="light-shade-part">
          Made with fermented tea leaves, black tea has the highest caffeine
          content and forms the basis for flavored teas like chai, along with
          some instant teas. Studies have shown that black tea may protect lungs
          from damage caused by exposure to cigarette smoke. It also may reduce
          the risk of stroke.

        <h4>Assam Black Tea</h4>
        <p>
          This tea is primarily grown in the Assam region in India. Good Assam
          tea is boldly fragrant but not overpowering. A first sip may uncover
          astringent and tannic qualities. However, a rich aftertaste of roasted
          malt and creamy chocolate makes for a smooth finish.

        <h4>Darjeeling Black Tea</h4>
        <p>
          This exclusive black tea is grown only in Darjeeling, India. First
          flush Darjeelings are pure heaven. As the first pluckings of the
          season, first flush Darjeelings yield the freshest, most fragrant
          teas. Today's Darjeelings may also be derived from the
          assamica/sinensis hybrids developed by Lord William Bentinck and his
          Tea Committee in the 19th century. Generally, there are four
          Darjeeling flushes: first (between February and May), second (between
          May and June), monsoon (July to September), and autumn (October to
          November).

        <h4>Earl Gray</h4>
        <p>
          This pleasant tea is mainly Assam or Darjeeling tea infused with
          bergamot oil. Bergamot is a type of citrus grown in southern Italy and
          is said to derive from a fusion of bitter orange and lemon. Often,
          Earl Grays are combined with vanilla, giving the tea a citrusy natural
          sweetness and warmth. There are other variations of Earl Gray, such as
          French Earl Gray, which includes combinations of rose petals,
          calendula, hibiscus, or cornflowers. Meanwhile, the aromatic
          lemongrass takes center stage in Russian Earl Gray. Overall, this
          fruity, floral tea is a popular black tea blend.

        <h4>Ceylon Black Tea</h4>
        <p>
          The first tea plants in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) originated from the Chinese
          sinensis variety, which the British brought over in 1824. By 1840, the
          British were importing Assam tea seeds to the island colony in spades.
          They were so successful in their tea hegemonic goals that Ceylon
          emerged as the world's leading tea exporter in 1965. Ceylon black teas
          boast full-bodied citrusy flavors, with subtle chocolaty nuances.
