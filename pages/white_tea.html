          White tea may refer to one of several styles of tea which generally
          feature young or minimally processed leaves of the Camellia sinensis
          plant. Currently there is no generally accepted definition of white
          tea and very little international agreement; some sources use the term
          to refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing,
          some to tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves picked shortly
          before the buds have fully opened and allowed to wither and dry in
          natural sun,[citation needed] while others include tea buds and very
          young leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying. Most
          definitions agree, however, that white tea is not rolled or oxidized,
          resulting in a flavor characterized as "lighter" than most green or
          traditional black teas.

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p id="light-shade-part">
          Uncured and unfermented. One study showed that white tea has the most
          potent anticancer properties compared to more processed teas.

        <h4>Yin Zhen Bai Hao (Silver Needle)</h4>
        <p>
          Baihao Yinzhen, also known as White Hair Silver Needle, is a white tea
          produced in Fujian Province in China. Silver Needle or Bai Hao Yin
          Zhen or usually just Yin Zhen is the Chinese type of white tea.
          Amongst white teas, this is the most expensive variety and the most
          prized, as only top buds (leaf shoot) of the camellia sinensis plant
          are used to produce the tea.

        <h4>Bai Mu Dan (White Peony)</h4>
        <p>
          Bai Mu Dan White Peony King is a famous white tea made from the ‘two
          leaves and one bud’ standard of leaf picking. Mixed leaves produce a
          bright liquor with a sweet, woody aroma. The flavours are soft yet
          full, with herbaceous notes of light wood, fruits and a honey
          aftertaste.

        <h4>Gongmei (Tribute Eyebrow)</h4>
        <p>
          Gong Mei is produced from naturally withered upper leaf and tips, with
          a stronger flavor reminiscent of lighter Oolong teas. It is mostly
          grown in the Fujian Province Province in China. Because it is plucked
          later than Bai Mu Dan the tea may be darker in color, but it should
          still have a proportionate green color.<br />White tea has the most
          subtle flavor of all the teas, it is milder, contains less caffeine
          and thought to have the most antioxidant out of all the teas. Its
          refreshing and does not have an overwhelming tastes or scent compared
          to other teas. The difference between green and white tea is the
          production process where white tea does not go thru pan-frying, but
          instead allowed to wither.Gong Mei is produced from naturally withered

        <h4>Shou Mei (Noble, Long Life Eyebrow)</h4>
        <p>
          Shou Mei is also known as Long Noble Life Eyebrow due to its large,
          thin and crescent shaped leaves. Our Shou Mei comes from an organic
          tea garden (certified by IMO, Switzerland) at the Nine Peaks Mountains
          in Funding City, Fujian Province. This remote location reaches and
          altitude of 1000m has a slightly acidic soil that is excellent for
          growing tea. The unique terrain where the tea is growing in partially
          shaded by other trees and this adds to the exceptionally pure taste of
          this white tea.
          <br />
          The late harvest of these leaves produces a lower grade tea compared
          to our Silver Needle and White Peony, making Shou Mei a more
          affordable option for a white tea, but do not let the lower grade put
          you off – this tea is defiantly not one to be missed. Shou Mei is
          commonly served in Tea houses and restaurants all across Southern
          China as it effectively relieves thirst, and the refreshing and
          cooling nature of this tea works well in counteracting the heat of a
          rich and indulgent meal.
