      <p>
        White tea may refer to one of several styles of tea which generally
        feature young or minimally processed leaves of the Camellia sinensis
        plant. Currently there is no generally accepted definition of white tea
        and very little international agreement; some sources use the term to
        refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing, some to
        tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves picked shortly before the
        buds have fully opened and allowed to wither and dry in natural
        sun,[citation needed] while others include tea buds and very young
        leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying. Most definitions
        agree, however, that white tea is not rolled or oxidized, resulting in a
        flavor characterized as "lighter" than most green or traditional black
        teas.

      <h4>Yin Zhen Bai Hao (Silver Needle)</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Baihao Yinzhen, also known as White Hair Silver Needle, is a white tea
        produced in Fujian Province in China. Silver Needle or Bai Hao Yin Zhen
        or usually just Yin Zhen is the Chinese type of white tea. Amongst white
        teas, this is the most expensive variety and the most prized, as only
        top buds (leaf shoot) of the camellia sinensis plant are used to produce
        the tea.

      <h4>Bai Mu Dan (White Peony)</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Bai Mu Dan White Peony King is a famous white tea made from the ‘two
        leaves and one bud’ standard of leaf picking. Mixed leaves produce a
        bright liquor with a sweet, woody aroma. The flavours are soft yet full,
        with herbaceous notes of light wood, fruits and a honey aftertaste.

      <hr />
      <p>
        Gong Mei is produced from naturally withered upper leaf and tips, with a
        stronger flavor reminiscent of lighter Oolong teas. It is mostly grown
        in the Fujian Province Province in China. Because it is plucked later
        than Bai Mu Dan the tea may be darker in color, but it should still have
        a proportionate green color.<br />White tea has the most subtle flavor
        of all the teas, it is milder, contains less caffeine and thought to
        have the most antioxidant out of all the teas. Its refreshing and does
        not have an overwhelming tastes or scent compared to other teas. The
        difference between green and white tea is the production process where
        white tea does not go thru pan-frying, but instead allowed to
        wither.Gong Mei is produced from naturally withered upper leaf and tips,
