      <p>
        Oolong tea is a traditional Chinese tea. It’s made from the leaves of
        the Camellia sinensis plant, the same plant used to make green tea and
        black tea. The difference is in how the tea is processed. The process of
        oxidation is what creates green, dark, or oolong teas. Green tea is
        produced from fresh tea leaves that have not undergone oxidation, a
        chemical reaction that begins when the leaves are exposed to the air and
        which is responsible for the color and taste of different types of tea.
        Black tea is created when leaves are fully crushed to enhance oxidation,
        and oolong is created when leaves are wilted in the sun and slightly
        bruised to create partial oxidation.

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        In an animal study, those given antioxidants from oolong tea were found
        to have lower bad cholesterol levels. One variety of oolong, Wuyi, is
        heavily marketed as a weight loss supplement, but science hasn’t backed
        the claims.

      <h4>Phoenix Tea</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Phoenix oolong tea is produced in the Guangdong province of China and is
        among the bestsellers. The Chinese name for this tea means “single
        bush." The leaves of Phoenix oolong teas are harvested from one single
        bush of the tea plant. Each bush has a different flavor, meaning this
        tea tastes different with every batch. The dried leaves feature a curly
        appearance that slowly unfurls when steeping. <br />Today, Phoenix tea
        is also used to refer to all oolong teas produced in Guangdong
        province—not just the ones from a single bush. Phoenix teas are noted
        for their natural flavors and aromas of flowers and fruits.

      <h4>Iron Goddess of Mercy</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        This type of oolong tea is arguably the most famous Chinese tea. ‍Iron
        Goddess of Mercy tea is grown in the high mountainous region of the
        southern Fujian province. The tea leaves are harvested specifically in
        the Anxi region.<br />
        Legend has it that monks originally trained monkeys to harvest the
        leaves of tea plants along high cliff edges.<br />
        These tea leaves were often called “monkey-picked” and constituted the
        highest quality oolong teas. These oolong teas were only used to brew
        tea for the emperors of China.

      <h4>Wuyi Oolong Tea</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        On the other end of the oolong spectrum is Red Robe tea. Da Hong Pao
        oolongs are heavily oxidized and dark in color. This tea is revered for
        its health benefits and legend has it that this oolong tea saved the
        mother of an emperor in the Ming dynasty.<br />
        Da Hong Pao has a sharp, smoky flavor that is unique among oolong teas
        and similar to Formosa Gunpowder black tea. It boats hints of caramel,
        butter, and toast. These oolong tea leaves are fat, bold strips with a
        slightly glossy appearance. This roasted oolong tea is typically bright
        orange of yellow in color.

      <h4>High Mountain Oolong Tea</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        High Mountain oolong teas consist of a variety of different oolongs
        grown at the highest elevations in Taiwan. They are typically seasonal
        teas due to their production timeline. High Mountain oolongs include
        Alishan, Wu She, and Yu Shan. These oolongs are grown at altitudes
        higher than 3,300 feet and tend to grow more slowly than other
        oolongs.<br />
        High Mountain oolong teas are harvested by hand twice per year. The
        leaves harvested in October are known as winter Gaoshan and the leaves
        plucked in June are known as spring Gaoshan. The leaves are spread out
        on a large tarp to dry before undergoing oxidation. As the leaves dry,
        they develop aromas of rose, jasmine, and geranium.
